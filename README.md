### BIO

I am a teaching faculty at IFPR and a PhD student at PUC-Rio. I have a master's degree in Computer Science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-RIO) and a bachelor degree in Computer Science from the State University of MaringÃ¡ (UEM). I have over 12 years of software development experience, 6 of which were dedicated to teaching. I worked on research, development and consulting projects at the Software Engineering Laboratory at PUC-RIO (LES). I also worked as a developer at HSBC GLT, Objective Solutions and Cwork Sistemas. Most of my software development experience is with Java back-end development, using technologies like Java EE, JUnit and Oracle DB. I also have experience with full stack development (Spring Boot and Thymeleaf). Finally, I'm currently studying and developing front-end and mobile projects with React and Flutter. As an academic, I conduct research in the field of Software Engineering, focusing on the following topics: Software Architecture and Design, Code Smells, Refactoring, Empirical Software Engineering and Search-Based Software Engineering. In my PhD, I am working on a technique to assist developers in identifying and removing design problems that occur when quality attributes are negatively impacted.
